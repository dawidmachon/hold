# Hold 2.0

## Hold 2.0 is currently in active development.

It is my fork from awesome theme creator [BesrourMS/hold](https://github.com/BesrourMS/hold). I've start using this theme when I was building small website for friend, but some features was missing from orginal one [Hold HTML5 Template](http://freehtml5.co/hold).

---

Hold is a free Pico CMS Theme perfect for freelancers, creatives, web designer and developers alike to showcase their experience in an elegant way.

Download the identity folder, extract it to the themes folder of your Pico installation, and change the following setting within your config.php:

`$config['theme'] = 'hold';`

For the content download our `index.md`, upload it in the content folder and make your changes.

### Meta

There are two obligatory Meta : Job & Description for SEO reasons but for the others you can choose what you want to put on your webpage.

We use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) for social icons
You can add as many social icons as you want using the follow syntax:

```
Social:
  http://tn.linkedin.com/in/MohamedSafouanBesrour: linkedin
  https://github.com/BesrourMS: github
  url: icon
```
